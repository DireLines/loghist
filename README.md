# loghist

logs -> stdin -> live updating histograms

Usage:

`go run example/example.go | go run main.go`

![example-plot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b022e6af-ad0e-4813-af7b-b675e8778aaf)

`example/example.go` is a stand in for any program you want to plot the timing logs of.

Logs are expected on stdout and should follow the format `[any string describing a task] took [number] [time unit]`

Ex: `update: physics took 10.387667 millis`

Current valid strings for time units:

- `nanos`
- `nanoseconds`
- `ns`
- `micros`
- `microseconds`
- `Âµs`
- `millis`
- `milliseconds`
- `ms`
- `seconds`
- `s`
- `sec`
- `secs`

`main.go` will capture the timing log output of the program and serve a page charting it as a stacked histogram at `localhost:8080`

Any command line args to `main.go` will be interpreted as filters on the resulting histogram. If supplied, only task names containing at least one filter as a substring will be shown.

Ex:
`go run example/example.go | go run main.go serial parallel`
